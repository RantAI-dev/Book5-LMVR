### For Students

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<em>LMVRâ€”Large Language Models via Rust</em> is available as a free, open-source web book at <a href="http://lmvr.rantai.dev" target="_blank">http://lmvr.rantai.dev</a>. It is structured to provide a step-by-step learning experience, starting with fundamental concepts and gradually progressing to advanced topics. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so it is highly recommended to follow the sequence without skipping chapters to ensure a strong foundational understanding.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
LMVR adopts the FCP (Fundamental, Conceptual, Practical) learning framework:
</p>

- **Fundamental**: Understand the theoretical principles underpinning LLMs, including mathematics, neural network architectures, and Transformer models.
- **Conceptual**: Explore high-level abstractions like advanced transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5) to design and optimize LLMs.
- **Practical**: Apply your knowledge with hands-on coding exercises using Rust, including building, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To make the most of this book:
</p>

1. Dedicate sufficient time to each chapter, ideally a week per chapter, to absorb the material and complete the practical exercises.
2. Use integrated tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and CodeLLM to analyze, optimize, and practice coding examples.
3. Take advantage of case studies and expert tips provided in each chapter to contextualize your learning and apply concepts effectively.
