<em>Part II of "Large Language Models via Rust (LMVR)"</em> takes readers into the realm of advanced transformer architectures, which have become the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. This section begins with Chapter 5, which explores bidirectional models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and its variants, focusing on how they utilize bidirectional context to enhance NLP tasks. Chapter 6 shifts focus to generative models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), examining their role in text generation and language modeling. Chapter 7 introduces multitask learning models like T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer), showcasing how unifying various NLP tasks into a single framework improves efficiency and versatility. Finally, Chapter 8 delves into multimodal transformers, exploring how they integrate diverse data types like text, images, and video for complex tasks across domains. Together, these chapters equip readers with the knowledge and skills to implement and optimize state-of-the-art LLMs using Rust.
