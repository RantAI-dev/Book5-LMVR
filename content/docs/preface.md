Welcome to <em>LMVR - Large Language Models via Rust</em>, a groundbreaking guide that explores the intersection of cutting-edge AI and the unmatched strengths of Rust. As the field of artificial intelligence evolves, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs), the need for scalable, efficient, and reliable programming solutions becomes increasingly evident. Rustâ€™s performance, memory safety, and concurrency make it a compelling choice for developing robust LLM applications, and this book aims to help you unlock that potential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In <em>LMVR</em>, we explore how Rustâ€™s ecosystem, coupled with open-source tools like <code>burn</code> and <code>candle</code>, provides the foundation for creating state-of-the-art LLMs. These frameworks enable the development of high-performance neural architectures, optimized for both training and deployment in real-world applications. By bridging Rust's systems-level capabilities with the requirements of AI, we aim to push the boundaries of LLM development, showcasing how Rust can rivalâ€”and even surpassâ€”more traditional languages in this space.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>burn</code>: A modular, high-level framework for creating deep learning models in Rust, designed to facilitate experimentation and scalability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>candle</code>: A lightweight, fast library optimized for deploying pre-trained models, making it ideal for LLM inference at scale.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our journey in creating this book was supported by cutting-edge Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, including ChatGPT and Gemini. These tools were instrumental in synthesizing knowledge, providing clarity, and ensuring that <em>LMVR</em> reflects the latest advancements in the rapidly evolving world of LLMs. By leveraging AI-driven insights alongside human expertise, weâ€™ve crafted a resource that is as comprehensive as it is accessible, designed for learners and practitioners alike.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<em>LMVR</em> is more than just a technical manual; itâ€™s a testament to the transformative power of combining Rust's capabilities with the possibilities of AI. Through step-by-step guides, practical exercises, and real-world case studies, this book equips you with the skills to design, build, and deploy large language models effectively. Whether you are an academician, a student, or a professional, <em>LMVR</em> provides the theoretical foundations and practical tools needed to excel in this exciting field.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We are especially proud to bring this book to the global AI and software engineering communities from Indonesia. At RantAI, we believe in empowering the next generation of AI practitioners by fostering innovation and collaboration. Our hope is that <em>LMVR</em> will inspire you to explore Rust's potential, contributing to a thriving community of developers who are shaping the future of AI.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As you embark on this journey, we invite you to join us in advancing the frontiers of AI through Rust. Together, we can create scalable, secure, and impactful solutions that drive innovation and contribute to the global AI community. Let <em>LMVR</em> be your guide as you explore the exciting possibilities of large language models in Rust.
