<p style="text-align: justify;">
The field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the development of large language models (LLMs), has been rapidly evolving, with most implementations relying on languages like Python due to their ease of use and extensive libraries. However, as these models grow in complexity and are deployed in increasingly demanding environments, the limitations of existing languages become apparent. In this context, we see immense potential in Rust as the main language for the development of LLM applications. Rust offers unparalleled memory safety, performance optimization, and concurrency, which are critical for building scalable and reliable AI systems that can operate efficiently in real-world settings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our journey in creating LMVR - Large Language Model via Rust was driven by the inspiration to bring the power of Rust into the domain of LLMs. We set out to reproduce and enhance many of the state-of-the-art LLM models using Rust, leveraging open-source crates like burn and candle. These tools, coupled with Rustâ€™s unique capabilities, provide the foundation for developing sophisticated neural architectures that can meet the high-performance requirements of modern AI applications. By doing so, we aim to demonstrate Rust's potential to not only match but exceed the capabilities of more traditional languages in the field of AI, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in LLM development.

<!-- - <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>burn</code>: A modular, high-level framework for creating deep learning models in Rust, designed to facilitate experimentation and scalability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>candle</code>: A lightweight, fast library optimized for deploying pre-trained models, making it ideal for LLM inference at scale.</p> -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In crafting this book, we embraced the cutting-edge advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, utilizing tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini. These AI-driven tools were instrumental in the writing process, allowing us to summarize and synthesize state-of-the-art knowledge with a level of precision and clarity that might otherwise have been difficult to achieve. The use of GenAI reflects our deep commitment to capturing the most current and relevant insights in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs, ensuring that LMVR is both comprehensive and accessible to a wide audience of learners and practitioners.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
LMVR is not merely a technical guide; it is a manifestation of our passion for advancing AI through the seamless integration of human expertise and AI-assisted knowledge creation. This book represents our belief that by combining the rigorous, systems-level capabilities of Rust with the vast possibilities of LLMs, we can create tools that are not only powerful but also adaptable to the varied and complex needs of modern AI applications. We have poured our dedication into making LMVR a resource that serves as both an educational foundation and a source of inspiration for those looking to explore and expand the frontiers of AI.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We envision LMVR as a significant contribution to the AI and software engineering communities, particularly within Indonesia. Our goal is to empower students, educators, and developers with the knowledge and tools to harness Rust for LLM development, fostering a new era of innovation and expertise in AI. We believe that by equipping a new generation of AI practitioners with these skills, we can contribute to a thriving community that leads advancements in AI on a global scale.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As you delve into the chapters of LMVR, we invite you to join us in this journey of exploration and discovery. This book is designed to be your guide, providing the theoretical foundations, practical insights, and technical skills necessary to master large language models using Rust. Whether you are an academician, a student, or a professional in the industry, LMVR is crafted to help you not only learn but also contribute to the ongoing evolution of AI. Together, we can shape the future of AI development, making meaningful contributions that will resonate far beyond the confines of the classroom or the laboratory, ultimately driving progress and innovation in the global AI community.
